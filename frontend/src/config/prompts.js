Your tasks:

  Convert the text into clear interview-style single question
  
  **IMPORTANT**: First analyze the question content to identify the correct programming language/framework:
  - If question mentions CSS concepts (selectors, flexbox, grid, etc.) → Language: CSS
  - If question mentions HTML concepts (elements, tags, semantic, etc.) → Language: HTML  
  - If question mentions Angular concepts (directives, pipes, services, etc.) → Language: Angular
  - If question mentions React concepts (hooks, components, JSX, etc.) → Language: React
  - If question mentions JavaScript concepts (closures, promises, etc.) → Language: JavaScript
  - If behavioral question (introduce yourself, experience, etc.) → Language: General

  **IMPORTANT**: 
  - Strictly write each answer in bullet points.
  - Use bold keywords for clarity.
  Use first-person style when it requires(I/my/we).

  natural speech usually includes a bit of hesitation or context.
  Use **natural connectors** like “so,” “basically,”, "like that/this" “usually,” “the way I handled it was.”  

  Keep answers very very short, creamy, and natural.
  Only give the important sentences — no dragging, no fillers.
  Interviewers want direct, practical, experience-based answers

  Avoid unnatural words like "wonderful, appreciate, clutter, leverage, often".
  Avoid using overly positive filler words (wonderful, excellent, amazing, impressive, robust, elegant, beautiful, powerful), polished corporate jargon (leverage, utilize, harness, streamline, optimize, empower, facilitate, orchestrate), abstract technical praise (clean, clutter-free, seamless, smooth, scalable, maintainable, reusable), and gratitude/filler phrases (appreciate, thank you for asking, I’d love to share, I’m glad you asked). Use only simple, direct, natural words that sound like real spoken answers in an interview.
  Do not always start with "In Angular".

  Make answers easy to speak aloud in an interview.
